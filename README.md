Nagar, Bangalore, I'm eager to apply my skills in the IT industry and explore opportunities in machine learning, AI and python development.

## 💻 What I Do

- 🔍 **Machine Learning & AI** – Specializing in image classification, real-time object detection, and AI-powered applications..
- 📱 **Android App Development** – Developing `coconut maturity detection app`, a real-time detection app using YOLO.
- 🖼️ **Computer Vision & Image Processing** – Expertise in image segmentation, feature extraction, and enhancement techniques.
- 💼 **Career Aspirations** – Looking for opportunities in Machine Learning and aspiring to become a Python Developer.


## 📌 Projects

### 🥥 Coconut Maturity Stage Classification
Developed a machine learning-based system to classify coconuts into **Tender**, **Middle**, and **Dry** maturity stages using image processing and computer vision techniques.  
- 📸 Trained on real-time collected coconut images (with background removed)  
- 🔍 Applied traditional feature extraction techniques for pattern recognition  
- 🧠 Used ML models for accurate stage prediction  
- 🎯 Supports **automated harvest planning** and **quality control**

### 🌴 Coconut Maturity Detection (Real-time)
Built a real-time coconut maturity detection system using **YOLOv8 instance segmentation**.  
- 🎥 Collected 497 real-time images of coconut bunches with complex backgrounds  
- 🤖 Trained a YOLOv8 model for detecting **Tender**, **Middle**, and **Dry** coconut bunches  
- 📲 Ideal for integration into mobile or embedded devices for **field-level maturity detection**

### 🌾 Paddy Variety Classification
Implemented an image processing-based classification model to identify different paddy varieties such as **Kuruva**, **Jaya**, **Jyothi**, **1001**, and **Small**.  
- 🔍 Used traditional feature extraction methods: **color histogram**, **LBP**, and **GLCM**  
- 🧠 Combined with ML classifiers for robust performance  
- ✅ Supports **agricultural quality analysis** and **automated sorting**
